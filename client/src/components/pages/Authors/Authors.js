                        to portray on the page the realistic and often bizarre behaviors observed. Having worked
                        in the corporate, academic and non-profit worlds, Prigot has written or co-written eight
                        non-fiction publications and nine grants, made 13 regional or national presentations about
                        human behavior, and edited or co-edited 10 manuscripts on various topics. Happily
                        getting lost in science fiction and fantasy genres as a coping mechanism through the
                        years, Prigot is thrilled to be involved with S.J. Evans on a young-adult fantasy duology
                        that has the epic structure of Dune, the social consciousness of Star Trek and the growth
                        steps of Princess Diaries. Prigot holds a BA and a BFA from Queens College and a PhD
                        in Developmental Psychology from Stony Brook University. Prigot currently lives in
                        Boynton Beach on the east coast of southern Florida."
